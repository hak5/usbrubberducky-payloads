REM This short Powershell one-liner executes from the Windows Run dialog.
REM The drive letter of the volume with the label “DUCKY” is saved as $m.
REM The netsh command will get the network name and passphrase for the currently connected network ((Get-NetConnectionProfile).Name).
REM The results of the netsh command (filtered for only SSID and key) will be redirected (saved) to a file on the root of the “DUCKY” drive, saved as the computer name (in .txt format).
