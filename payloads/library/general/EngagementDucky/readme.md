**What is EngagementDucky?**
#
<p>EngagementDucky will help you generating your evidence. Typical proof of compromise is normally something harmless like a message in notepad on your targets machine. This payload will pop a message box, containing Username, Hostname, Time and Date. Afterwards Ducky will generate a screenshot of this message box and will save it. Afterwards you can walk away. Combine this with specific USB identifiers to help identifying you.<br>
Step up your game and demonstrate impact in a few seconds without leaving your scope.</p>
