## About:
A badUSB script that gains full admin access to a windows machine from the login screen.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: This only works on machines with a local account; if you use an account connected to Microsoft, this will not work!

## Note for pico-ducky
You might have to remove the following line as its not supported by the pico-ducky, but worry, the code should work just fine without it. ```EXTENSION PASSIVE_WINDOWS_DETECT```

### How it works:
1. It reboots into safe mode
2. It opens a cmd from safe mode
3. It changes the Utilman.exe to be a cmd.exe
4. It boots back into windows
5. It opens the help menu which has been replaced with a cmd instance
6. It creates a new admin account named ```rubberDucky``` with the password ```1234```
7. It logs into the new account
