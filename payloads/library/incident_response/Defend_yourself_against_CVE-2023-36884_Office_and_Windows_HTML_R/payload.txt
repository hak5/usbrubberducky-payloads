REM Requirements:
REM     - ExecutionPolicy Bypass

REM Impact: Remote Code Execution
REM Max Severity: Important

REM Mitigation:

REM     - Customers who use Microsoft Defender for Office are protected from attachments that attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

REM     - The registry key FEATURE_BLOCK_CROSS_PROTOCOL_FILE_NAVIGATION is located in the Main folder under the Internet Explorer settings, within the path HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\FeatureControl. This registry key is used to mitigate the vulnerability known as "Office and Windows HTML Remote Code Execution Vulnerability" (CVE-2023-36884).

REM The CVE-2023-36884 vulnerability allows remote code execution through the processing of HTML files by Office and Windows applications. Creating this registry key and adding specific application values, such as REG_DWORD with data 1, helps block cross-protocol file navigation to mitigate the exploitation of this vulnerability.

REM It is recommended to implement these protective measures to prevent potential attacks that could exploit the vulnerability and compromise the security of Office and Windows systems. It is important to understand the implications of modifying the registry and carefully evaluate the impact on the regular functionality of the involved applications.
