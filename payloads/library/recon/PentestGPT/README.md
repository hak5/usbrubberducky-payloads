- Formats the collected information into a request for GPT-3.5 Turbo.
- Generates a pentesting report in HTML based on the response from GPT-3.5 Turbo.
- Demonstrates basic code obfuscation techniques.
- Saves the report on the user's desktop.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have PowerShell and access to the OpenAI API.
2. Run the script.
3. Check the generated report on the user's desktop.
