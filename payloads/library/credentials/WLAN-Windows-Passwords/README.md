## What Version should i use?
### Version 1.0 by [allef-github](https://github.com/aleff-github):
This version uses a very direct way, is a bit faster then v.2.0 and the PowerShell script is very short, but it only sends the Wifi Name and Password to the webhook and does only work on English Machines.
Also the Payload has a few more lines.

### Version 2.0 by [truelockmc](https://github.com/truelockmc):
This Version works on every Windows Machine, no matter what language your system is.
Version 2.0 also sends you more Information to the Webhook, and so it also gives you access to networks that are secured with other Methods then Passwords.
The down side is that Version 2.0 writes stuff on the disk, version 1.0 not, also v.2.0 takes a few seconds longer to execute and the PowerShell script is longer.
The Payload is shorter and formatted so its easier to read.
