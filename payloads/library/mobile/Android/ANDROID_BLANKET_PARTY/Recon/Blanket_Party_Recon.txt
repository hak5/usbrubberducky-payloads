REM #TITLE: Android 13 Payload
REM #AUTHOR: $@LVAT10N!
REM #DESCRIPTION: Android payload to support android 13. This payload will 
REM # brute force a 4 digit pin and take 10 screenshots of contacts, 10
REM # screenshots of text logs, 5 screenshots of the browser history,
REM # one screenshot of notifications, one screenshot of current email,
REM # and 1 screenshot of the last number called. Then move all 
REM # screenshots to the ducky storage. Once the pin is cracked press the
REM # ducky button once to start stage 2 of the payload ( gathering INTEL) 
REM # If you would like to add more pin guesses and pin randomization consider 
REM # replacing the bottom of this script with my "pin-crack" attack. This
REM # script is intended to give you 5 attempts with pins you have gathered
REM # from recon.This attack will take all screenshots on the device, not
REM # just the ones the ducky takes, 50% of screenshots are accidents the other
REM # 50% are important things that cannot be forgotten. Make sure your ducky
REM # has enough storage to accomidate this attack.
