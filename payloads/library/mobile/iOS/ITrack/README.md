**ITrack** is a simple **Rubber Ducky Payload** developed for **IOS** which uses the **Full Keyboard Access** capabilities of an Iphone to **grant Location Sharing** for 24h to an Email Address of Choice:
1. Opens **Google Maps**
2. Opens **Location Sharing Settings**
3. Sets the Timer to **24h**
4. Enables Sharing for an **Email of Choice**

## Disclaimer

While also not used to harm, attack or unbuckle anyone's rights to privacy and informational freedom, ever

## Setup
The Payload requires **Full Keyboard Access to be enabled** to run properly. There are also some differences between the **2 version**:
- <u>**ITrack.txt:**</u>
	- **USB Rubber Ducky** Payload
	- **Speed Optimization** from Flipper
- <u>**ITrack_CrossPV.txt:**</u>
	- **USB Rubber Ducky** Payload
	- Default Delay of 600ms & Minor Custom Delays

1. **Enable Full Keyboard Access**
2. Set your **Email of Choice**
3. **Upload Payload** to Keyboard Emulator
4. **Connect** to Phone
5. **!!!SEND IT!!!**

## Limitations
Sadly the **Payload is not perfect** and is not completely cross-platform. Additionally there are still some limitations that I would like to work on in the future with the community to make the payload more sophisticated and maybe even faster than it already is(~12s).
- Required **Full Keyboard Access** to be enabled manually
- Requires a **Newer Version of Google Maps** which doesn't support "Sharing until I turn it off"
- Requires all **Permissions for Google's Location Sharing** to already be accepted
- Requires the **Location Sharing List** to be empty
- Requires to physcially/over **Bluetooth connect** to the Emulator manually(**Working on a Solution**)

## Modification
Please **modify, customize and improve** on the payload as much as your hearth desired. Share your versions with the community as long as you **credit me** in some way or form(Name/Github). I would love to work with the community on improvements!!!
